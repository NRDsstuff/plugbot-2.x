# betterbot-plugins
a new version of betterbot, now supporting plugins instead of commands and features
## dependencies
### to install dependencies, open install-dependencies (sh for linux or mac, bat for windows)
### on mac instead of typing ./install-dependencies.sh type bash install-dependencies.sh
### to install plugins, just copy and paste the plugin files (like plugins, logs, configs (whatever the dev wants to add)) and they will load automatically
